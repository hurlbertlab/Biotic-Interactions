This project seeks to understand why species exhibit patchy distributions within their range. 
Plan:

Clark paper, Belmaker paper

use phylogenetic distance combined with a functional dendrogram based on similarity matrix

potentially use guilds (dietary, functional)

for short-term:

pick a species with 30-50% range occupancy (woodpecker/nuthatch/chickadee)

look at closest relatives and ecological competitors

perform correlational analyses of abundances

temporal occupancy vs presence/absence of competitor of focal species (model)

how climatically optimal is si to GT towhee? LAst sem abiotic project

lm(GT abundance ~ spotted, abiotic)

generalize to focal ~ competitor

variance partitioning on biotic vs abiotic?

eventually fix modis data
